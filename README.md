## AI Research System

This folder has been populated with a starter Python project called **AI Research System**.

### What this project is

- A small, extensible Python project scaffold you can use to build tools or experiments for AI research.
- Includes:
  - `main.py`: simple entry-point script.
  - `src/ai_research_system/core.py`: placeholder for your main logic.
  - `requirements.txt`: where Python dependencies are listed.

### Getting started

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows PowerShell / CMD
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

You can now customize the code in `src/ai_research_system` to fit your own AI research workflows.
